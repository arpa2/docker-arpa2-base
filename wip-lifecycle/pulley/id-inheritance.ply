# SteamWorks Pulley script for Identity Inheritance.
#
# The InternetWide Architecture places great emphasis on
# identity and personal control over it, in a desire to
# allow everyday users good control over their online
# presence.  As part of this design, there will be an
# infrastructure of accounts and security mechanisms.
#
# As part of the flexible management of identities, a
# number of kinds of identity have been identified, and
# relationships are designed to allow the management of
# these identities.  Not just pseudonyms and lighter
# aliases, but even separate identities for group members
# and role occupants, so users of those identities need
# not be aware of the underlying basic identity.
#
# The implementation of Identity Inheritance requires
# some investigation into the structures setup for it
# in the IdentityHub, so in terms of LDAP objects.  With
# SteamWorks Pulley, an application can subscribe to
# this advanced model and have the result delivered to
# it in the form of backend calls that can setup whatever
# is desired to arrange things locally.
#
# We start from a node named "idhub" which is supposed
# to be externally defined as an LDAP server to which
# to subscribe for identity information with immediate
# updates upon changes.  We retrieve all the domains in
# this repository at once, in support of bulk service.
#
# For more information, see the "identity tag",
# http://internetwide.org/tag/identity.html

# Bind to user/group/role names and domain for all the
# users known to the IdentityHub to which we subscribe.
#
# Requires: idhub.
# Provides: uid, domain.

# Bind the login names that may precede a user, which is
# then effectively a pseudonym.

# Requires: idhub, domain, uid.
# Provides: login.

# TODO (this stuff is difficult!)
