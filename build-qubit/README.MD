# Quantum Computer Simulation

> *Doing things with qubits.*

A list of software can be found on
[Quantiki](https://quantiki.org/wiki/list-qc-simulators).

## First attempt, fluked

We setup
[Scaffold/ScaffCC](https://github.com/epiqc/ScaffCC)
which is a frontend language to LLVM, and it is open source.
It is
[described here](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/research/techreps/TR-934-12).

You might need some
[background](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/tutorial?sectionId=beginners-guide&page=introduction)
to catch up.

If you get your things going, consider using a
[real quantum computer](https://www.research.ibm.com/ibm-q/)
online...


## Second attempt, simpler

We have made a
[QCL](http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~oemer/qcl.html)
environment because the same Quantiki described it as the most extensive language.

It connects to GNU plot and is otherwise a commandline environment, started with the `qcl` command.

Again, some of the
[online documentation](http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~oemer/qcl.html#doc)
may be usedful, particularly the
[language manual](http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~oemer/doc/quprog.pdf).

We should probably add a link to a MOOC on this topic?


*Enjoy!*
