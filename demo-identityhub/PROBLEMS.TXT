3. Keytab for OpenLDAP.
   This can be set in the default manner,
   using something along the lines of
   export KRB5_KTNAME=/etc/ldap/krb5-ldap.keytab
   The alternative is the default keytab
   /etc/krb5.keytab but made readable to slapd.
   But can we set the envvar reliably and just
   for OpenLDAP?

   *DONE:** Add it to `/etc/default/slapd`

6. Getting ports actually exported, so users
   can access web2ldap (when it runs again)
   and OpenLDAP (with GSSAPI from a desktop).

   **DONE:** On Mac OS X, this is done via
   `localhost` -- which leaves us with new a
   problem due to Kerberos' DNS reverse lookups.


This is how we gain access to LDAP with GSSAPI:

```
import ldap
dap = ldap.initialize ('ldap://identityhub.arpa2:1389')
sasl_auth = ldap.sasl.gssapi ()
dap.sasl_interactive_bind_s ('', sasl_auth)
```

Or we can use

```
ldapsearch -Y GSSAPI ...
```
