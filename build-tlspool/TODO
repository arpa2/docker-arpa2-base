For a web demo based on Python:
 + apt-get install libpython2.7-dev

CMake:
 + install <tlspool/*.h> -- CMakeLists.txt wants to but it is not done?
 X export CFLAGS=-I../../include before building _quickder.so
 + install the Python plugin -- setup.py builds and installs tlspool.py and _tlspool.so
 X install the Python demos
 - prefix all installed binaries with "tlspool-"

README:
 + careful with IPv6, it blocks the webdemo if non-routeable

Docker:
 + install libpython-dev before building Python's _quickder.so

TLS Pool:
 X many type-based warnings when building _quickder.so (seemingly harmless)
 + support a variable website in webdemo, please
 X consider automatic fallback to IPv4, with a delay
 - try again with the HTTPS_PROXY, using Twisted Python
 - wonder why the webclientdemo.py and webserverdemo.py fail
