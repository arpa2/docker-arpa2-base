# Wish list for Docker - Qemu - Raspbian

 1. Use `debootstrap` to setup a minimal context
 2. Install the supported software for (at least) `build-bin`
 3. Share the Raspbian FS with a Docker subdirectory
 4. Share the Raspbian network configuration (and interface)
 5. Test ARPA2 software on Raspbian with this setup
 6. Build Raspbian packages for ARPA2 software
