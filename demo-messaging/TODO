- switch from wrapping command lines to JSON processing
+ server cannot handle consecutive clients yet (fixed corlid?)
+ client should be more temporary (address, random corlid)
+ client should use proper corlid for actual traffic
+ remove debugging messages (some day)
- add queue/exchange names to connect to (argv, env, cfgfile?)
+ try to automatically login the client? creds from other process?
- find a form to send back GSSAPI errors (unencrypted ASCII)
- prefixes OPEN(ing), DATA, COMM(unicating), NYET(noty_ready), TIME(out)
+ add ping, ping6, whoami, echo, date to arpa2cmd
+ actually make the shells work with the utility ;-)
+ avoid ">> > " in output lines
+ properly concatenate answers in batch scripts
- program wrapper classes for secure remoting client/server
- work on non-shell, binary alternatives; at least, Diameter
- construct a arpa2shells package with shells and secure remoting
- consider linkage with SCTP streams connecting to the broker
- documentation is all over the place: howto, explanation, design
- gently handle ticket expiration (shell error, not crash)
- remove hacky flag for immediate errors and exceptions
- deal with timeouts due to queues for crashed microservices
